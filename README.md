# NLTK-Book

This repository is a record of my exploration into Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the book 'Natural Language Processing with Python'. It consists of exercises, code snippets, and projects for each chapter in the book.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `NLTK_Book.pdf`: This is the PDF version of 'Natural Language Processing with Python'.
- `Chapter_XX.py`: These are Python scripts corresponding to each chapter in the book, where XX is the chapter number. Each script includes the exercises, examples, and projects from the respective chapter.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries, if not already installed: nltk, matplotlib.
3. Start exploring NLP with the book and the corresponding Python scripts.

## Contributing

Please feel free to fork this repository and contribute by submitting a pull request to enhance the solutions and resources.
